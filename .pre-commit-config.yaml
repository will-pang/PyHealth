# .pre-commit-config.yaml:
# This file configures the 'pre-commit' framework, defining a set of automated
# checks (hooks) that run against your code before each Git commit. These hooks
# help maintain code quality, consistency, and identify potential issues early
# in the development cycle by enforcing coding standards, formatting rules,
# and other validations.
#
# Each 'repo' entry specifies a Git repository containing hooks, along with
# its revision and the specific 'id' of the hooks to be used from that repository.
# Common uses include linting, code formatting, syntax checks, and secret detection.

# Hook for clearing Jupyter notebook outputs before committing
# This helps keep the repository clean and minimize risk of committing sensitive data.
