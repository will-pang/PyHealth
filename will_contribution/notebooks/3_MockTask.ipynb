She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses.

She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n\\n# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic \\nhyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \\nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \\ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \\nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \\n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \\nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \\ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \\n\\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \\nbiweekly BMPs (script written).
