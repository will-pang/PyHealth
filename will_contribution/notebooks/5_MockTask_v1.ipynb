She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code.
